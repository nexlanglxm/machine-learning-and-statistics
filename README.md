   Access the `tasks.ipynb` file.
   - For Iris Dataset Project: Open and explore the `project.ipynb` file.

# Task 1:

# Iris Dataset Project

## Overview:
This project aims to explore classification algorithms using the famous Iris flower dataset associated with Ronald A Fisher. The focus is on demonstrating an understanding of supervised learning, classification algorithms, and implementing at least one common classification algorithm using the scikit-learn Python library.

## Contents of Notebook Files:

- **Introduction to Supervised Learning**:
  - Definition and principles of supervised learning.
  - Importance of labeled data for training.

- **Understanding Classification Algorithms**:
  - Explanation of classification algorithms in supervised learning.
  - Discussion on the significance of classifying data.

- **Exploring the Iris Dataset**:
  - Data visualization, statistical analysis, and characteristics of the Iris dataset.

- **Introduction to Support Vector Machines (SVM)**:
  - Explanation of SVM and its role in classification tasks.
  - Concepts like hyperplanes, support vectors, and kernel functions.

- **Implementation of SVM using scikit-learn**:
  - Code walkthrough demonstrating the implementation of an SVM classifier on the Iris dataset.
  - Evaluation metrics and visualizations to assess the classifier's performance.

## References:
- List of resources, articles, and documentation referred to during the project.
